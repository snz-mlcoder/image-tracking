# ðŸŽ¯ Image Tracking Practice Series with OpenCV

This repository contains a collection of hands-on computer vision projects focused on **image tracking** using Python and OpenCV. It is designed to help you learn practical techniques for detecting, following, and analyzing objects in video streams.

Each folder contains a self-contained mini-project with clean, readable code and explanations.

## ðŸš€ What's Inside

| Folder | Title | Description |
|--------|-------|-------------|
| `01_frame_differencing` | Frame Differencing | Detect motion by comparing consecutive grayscale frames |
| `02_colorspace_tracking | Color Detection Tracker |Track a specific color (e.g., blue) using the **HSV colorspace |
| `03_interactive_object_tracker | Interactive Object Tracker | Track object in real-time using the **CAMShift algorithm |
| `04_feature_based_tracking`   | Feature-Based Tracking      | Track motion of feature points using Lucas-Kanade Optical Flow              |

> More techniques will be added as the project evolves!
