#  Interactive Object Tracker (CAMShift)

This project allows you to **manually select an object** with the mouse and track it in real-time using the **CAMShift algorithm**.

---

## üñ±Ô∏è How It Works

1. Click and drag with the mouse to select the object (ROI).
2. The tracker computes a histogram of the selected region.
3. CAMShift tracks the object frame by frame using histogram backprojection.
4. The object is outlined with a green ellipse during tracking.
